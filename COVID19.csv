Initial posteroanterior chest radiograph and chest CT scan were performed on day of admission (3 days after onset of fever). Chest radiograph(A)shows no thoracic abnormalities. Axial CT scan(B)shows GGOs in subpleural area of right lower lobe. Left lung is normal. Patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs were almost absorbed leaving a few fibrous lesions that may represent residual organizing pneumonia. Repeat real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was negative and patient was discharged.

Echo (image 2, left) showed severely dilated RV, apical hypokinesis and McConnell's sign. PERT code was activated and pt was taken for stat CTA (image 3) revealing massive #Pulmonaryembolism (?saddle) but predominately occluding the entire R side. Systemic thrombolysis was considered, however, pt had known meningioma, which showed interval growth on stat CT head, raising concern for bleed. Within 4h of presentation, pt was taken to IR suite for embolectomy, which was successful at restoring flow to entire R lung field (image 4). Involvement of L pulmonary artery was non-occlusive and not intervened on. After the procedure, pt was taken for LE dopplers (image 5), which identified residual clot burden in the L profunda femoral vein.
